## Getting the Stylus add-on for your browser
We'll use Firefox in this tutorial, but you can do the same thing in the Chrome and Edge browsers.
1. Select **Add-ons and themes** from the browser menu or just press **Ctrl-Shift-A**.
2. Search for the add-on **stylus** and install it.
3. 3. Make sure that the Stylus extension is enabled. You should see that a Stylus button has been added to the browser toolbar.
